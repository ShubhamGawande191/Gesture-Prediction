# Gesture Prediction Project
### **Problem Statement :**

Natural control methods based on surface electromyography (sEMG) and pattern recognition are promising for hand prosthetics. However, the control robustness offered
by scientific research is still not sufficient for many real life applications, and commercial prostheses are capable of offering natural control for only a few movements. 
In recent years deep learning revolutionized several fields of machine learning, including computer vision and speech recognition.
The goal is to predict the gestures based on the data recorded by the MYO Thalmic bracelet.

### **Approach :**
The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. 
Try out different machine learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.
